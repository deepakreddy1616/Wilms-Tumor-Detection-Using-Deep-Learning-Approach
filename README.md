# Wilms Tumor Detection using Deep Learning Approach

Deep learning-based Wilms tumor detection system using YOLOv8 object detection model.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an automated detection system for Wilms tumors in medical images using the YOLOv8 architecture. The system includes data augmentation, model training, and evaluation pipelines.

## 📊 Features

- **Data Augmentation**: 16x augmentation using Albumentations
- **YOLOv8 Training**: Optimized for tumor detection
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics (mAP, precision, recall, F1-score)
- **Visualization**: Training curves and detection results
